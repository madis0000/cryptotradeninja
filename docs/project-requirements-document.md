# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements to transition the development environment of the joined project initiated on Replit to a local development environment using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This transition will involve adapting the environment configurations, dependencies, and database connection while preserving the existing logic and port configurations of the project.

## Objective
- Transition the project from Replit to VS Code.
- Adapt the environment to work seamlessly on the local machine.
- Replace the cloud database connection with a local PostgreSQL database connection.
- Ensure that the existing application logic and port configurations remain unchanged.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Environment Adaptation
- Identify all dependencies and environment configurations used in the Replit environment.
- Adapt and configure these dependencies for compatibility with the local development environment in VS Code.

### 2. Database Transition
- Replace the cloud database connection with a local PostgreSQL database connection.
- Ensure that the database schema and data from the cloud database are migrated to the local PostgreSQL database.

### 3. Preservation of Existing Logic and Ports
- Ensure that the existing application logic remains unchanged during the transition.
- Retain the current port configurations to avoid breaking any networking or communication logic.

---

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Dependencies
- Extract all dependencies from the Replit project (e.g., `package.json` for Node.js, `requirements.txt` for Python).
- Verify and install the equivalent dependencies locally.
- Update any platform-specific dependencies or configurations to work on the local machine.

### 2. Environment Variables
- Extract and document all environment variables used in the Replit environment.
- Configure these environment variables locally using a `.env` file for seamless integration with the application.

### 3. Database Configuration
- Extract the database schema and data from the cloud database.
- Set up a local PostgreSQL instance.
- Import the schema and data into the local PostgreSQL database.
- Update the database connection string in the application to use the local PostgreSQL database.

### 4. VS Code Configuration
- Set up a development environment in VS Code, including:
  - Debugging configurations.
  - Code formatting and linting tools (e.g., Prettier, ESLint).
  - Extensions required for the project (e.g., PostgreSQL extension, language-specific extensions).

### 5. GitHub Agent Integration
- Configure GitHub agent for CI/CD or GitHub Actions to work with the local development setup.
- Ensure GitHub agent can run tests and deployments with the updated dependencies and environment.

## Milestones and Deliverables

| Milestone                          | Deliverable                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dependency Extraction and Setup   | Local environment configured with all necessary dependencies and tools.     |
| Database Migration                 | Local PostgreSQL database set up with migrated schema and data.             |
| Code Refactoring for Local Setup  | Code updated to use local configurations without changing logic and ports.  |
| Testing and Validation             | Fully tested local setup with successful application execution.             |

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                                | Mitigation                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dependency Incompatibility          | Verify dependency versions and update where necessary.                     |
| Database Migration Errors           | Test migration scripts in a staging environment before applying locally.   |
| Environment Variable Misconfiguration | Document and test `.env` settings thoroughly.                              |

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- The project runs successfully on the local environment using VS Code.
- The application retains its original logic and port configurations.
- The local PostgreSQL database is fully functional and integrated with the application.
- GitHub agent is configured and operational for the local development setup.

---

## Additional Notes
- Ensure thorough documentation of changes during the transition to facilitate onboarding for other developers.
- Use version control (GitHub) to track all updates and configurations made during the process.
