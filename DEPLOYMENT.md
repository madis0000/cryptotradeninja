# Deployment Configuration Guide

## Overview
The crypto trading platform has been enhanced with comprehensive deployment compatibility for Replit and other cloud platforms.

## Key Deployment Fixes

### 1. Port Configuration
- **Development**: HTTP server on port 5000, WebSocket on dedicated port 8080
- **Production/Deployment**: Both HTTP and WebSocket on same port (5000) to avoid port conflicts
- Environment detection automatically handles Replit deployments

### 2. WebSocket Configuration
- Smart endpoint detection based on environment
- Production deployments use same-port WebSocket connections
- Development uses separate ports to avoid Vite HMR conflicts

### 3. Environment Detection
The system now detects deployment environments through:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `REPL_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable
- Hostname patterns (`.replit.app`, `repl.co`)

### 4. Build Process
- Frontend builds to `dist/public/`
- Backend builds to `dist/index.js`
- Production static file serving configured correctly

## Deployment Commands

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Start Production Server
```bash
npm run start
```

### Environment Variables for Production
- `NODE_ENV=production` (required)
- `PORT=5000` (default, can be overridden)
- `HOST=0.0.0.0` (default)
- `DATABASE_URL` (required)
- `JWT_SECRET` (recommended to set custom value)
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (recommended to set custom value)

## Configuration Files Modified

### server/config.ts
- Added deployment detection
- Enhanced port configuration
- WebSocket configuration per environment

### server/routes.ts
- Smart WebSocket server initialization
- Environment-aware server setup

### server/index.ts
- Improved environment detection
- Enhanced logging for deployment debugging

### client/src/hooks/useWebSocketService.ts
- Smart WebSocket endpoint configuration
- Production-compatible connection logic

## Verified Functionality

✅ Production build completes successfully  
✅ Static files served correctly from dist/public  
✅ WebSocket server uses same port in production  
✅ Environment detection works properly  
✅ Frontend assets load correctly  
✅ Security headers configured for production  

## Deployment Ready
The application is now fully configured for deployment on Replit and other cloud platforms with proper port handling and WebSocket configuration.
